                The First edition of the Annual Students' Symposium was held in the academic year 1987-88. 
                The novel initiative was formulated by Gouthama, presently a faculty member at IIT Kanpur. 
                Traditionally the aim, with which this event was envisaged, was to create a platform 
                for the students of the department to interact by presenting and sharing their research amongst themselves.
                With time, and with the induction of undergraduates, 
                this event has broadened to include the new members of the department, as well as try to 
                familiarise the students with the research done elsewhere. This year, we take pride in 
                ourselves by maintaining the legacy of this Annual Students' Symposium for 37 years.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-tight">
                Students' symposium serves as a platform for students to showcase their research, 
                share insights, and engage in meaningful discussions across various disciplines. 
                It is a testament to the intellectual vibrancy within our academic community. 
                This year's symposium promises to be a unique and enriching experience. 
                The diverse range of presentations and discussions will undoubtedly contribute 
                to the expansion of our collective understanding and inspire future breakthroughs. 
                This symposium is not just an event; it is a dynamic forum for the exchange of ideas, 
                fostering a spirit of inquiry and discussions. The interactions and knowledge shared during this 
                symposium will have a lasting impact on our academic journey. The 37th Annual Students' 
                Symposium will be held on 29th February and 1st March 2024. It gives us immense pleasure 
                to be a part of the organizing team of the students' symposium. We hope this gathering be a 
                source of inspiration, learning, and camaraderie for all.
